# Datcord Middleware for Typescript

This is a client middleware for the Datcord API.

This may not be the most optimal implementation, but it is the closest to the API.

### Syntax notes

Example:
tMessage - The static type for a message (derived from the API)
Message - The message class (implemented)
Fireball - The ID system used by Datcord and other projects of The P.A.I.N. Foundation.
